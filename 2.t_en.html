  <h1>The changes in Gödöllő's settlement structure from the middle to the end of the 20th century</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
      During the Second World War, the town did not suffer serious damages, there were houses which damaged or collapsed as a result of a bomb attack, but there was no contiguous damage involving the destruction of several streets. <br><br>
In 1951 the Múzeumok és Műemlékek Országos Központja (National Centre for Museums and Monuments) was commissioned to prepare the assessment of Gödöllő's townscape and monuments. Then 6 monuments and 19 historic edifice were put on the register. A significant number of the historic buildings were residential buildings on the Szabadság Square or on its continuation, the Szabadság Road. Almost the whole Szabadság Square was classified as protected townscape and unconditionally maintainable. <br><br>
The communist regime coming to power after the Second World War considered Gödöllő differently than the previous leaders. By this time the main goal was the suppression of the holiday town status and the settlement of industry. The town's population grew explosively in the postwar period. With the increase of the population the town's infrastructure was also developed. New shops, stores, office buildings and service buildings appeared in the town. Some of these were placed on the park area of the Szabadság Square, that was classified as protected. In the early 1970s, restaurants, stores, political party headquarters were built in the fashion of the appropriate style of the era.<br><br>
Of course, due to the increase in the number of population, housing shortage became a growing problem. At this point they preferred multi-storey blocks with large numbers of flats. Between 1966 and 1972, 1003 new flats were built in Gödöllő. The housing issue already entailed a change in the image of the town. As it was formulated in the IV five-year plan's objectives: "The large-scale housing construction works  in the inner area of Gödöllő town necessitated the liquidation of some houses."<br><br>
In 1971, a detailed arrangement draft plan was made for the central part of Gödöllő, and in 1973 the making of the general arrangement plan started as well. They raised up problems that spurred the competent authorities to run a design contest. Thus, in 1975, they announced a design contest. Its aim  was to provide complex transportation and installation proposals that would solve the relations and the transport problems of the suburban train - railway - coach stations, the town center and the No. 3 main road. In addition to solving traffic problems, the transformation of the town center was also an important task for the candidates. Candidates had to adapt their plans to the newly built buildings on the Szabadság Square, as expressed: "Since so far the new facilities of the centre were implemented in the open fields, independently of each other,  the candidates' task was to establish organic links between the center's already existing, newly built and planned facilities; to create a consistent, up-to-date, well-functioning town center around the existing and newly created urban spaces." With this they stated the leadership's desire to demolish houses standing on the square and build new and modern housing estates worthy of the socialist thinking. The monument assessment that was made 20 years earlier was completely ignored. In the late 1970s, almost every historic building was demolished along with the other houses and thus the protected townscape was fully liquidated, they buildings were mainly replaced by featureless panel houses. With this, the internal structure of the city irrevocably changed.<br><br>
In 1983 Mihály Ráday, in his historic preservation show, Our grandchildren will not see it either (Unokáink sem fogják látni) said the following about the city's socialist development: "in Gödöllő a lot of homes are being built, new housing estates, and the cityscape's dominant old buildings frequently fell victim to this expansion, such as the line of baroque houses on the Szabadság Square, shown on the picture. The number of the town's protected buildings has been halved over the last few years. Will this process stop? The houses you can see on the pictures don't exist anymore. This house on the next picture is being demolished. Even during the demolition the historic building board is still on the house. "<br><br>
The approach in the field of housing construction changed only at the end of the 1980s. With the change of approach new needs appeared, among which the most important was the relationship between the new and previous town parts. "The new buildings should adapt better to the established settlement structure, the full destruction of certain parts should be avoided, the buildings should adapt better to Gödöllő town's environment in their size, number of floors and appearance, to help in shaping the town's favorable proportions." The new approach came a little too late for Gödöllő.<br><br>
